Dear users,

starting from now Intel Python for Python 2 and 3 is available.
Intel Python is supposed to show better performance than the
regular Python installation. Intel Python comes with a lot of
Python modules like e.g. jupyter, ipython, numpy, scipy.
In case you are going to use Python in our queuing system,
please be sure to limit the number of cores used by Python to
the number of cores you requested for upon job submission.
Please add a line

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$NSLOTS  (for bash/sh)
or
setenv OMP_NUM_THREADS $NSLOTS  (for csh/tcsh)

in your job script somewhere before starting python.

In order to use Intel Python, please first call

module add intelpython2 (Python 2.7)
or
module add intelpython3 (Python 3.6)

before starting python.

Kind regards,
Hubert
