# delayCoupledDPLLnet

simulate DPLL(first-order-LF)-networks for different connection topologies, distributed intrinsic frequencies, distributed coupling strength, [distributed transmission delays], dynamic freq. noise and statistical analysis many noisy realizations; also contains a 'bruteforce'  analyzer of the basins of attraction for m-twist synchronized states
